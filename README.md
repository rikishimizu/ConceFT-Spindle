# ConceFT-Spindle

This repository is for the paper "Unveil Sleep Spindles with Concentration of Frequency and Time" by Riki Shimizu et al.

A detailed explanation of the parameters is given in the paper and the codes. The ConceFT codes used for this algorithm are available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280323900_ConceFT_Matlab_Code. Please download their files in your environment before running these codes.

For a given signal, first run getConceFT function in getConceFT.m and save the outputs (tftsqtic, ConceFT).

Then, run detectspindles function in detectspindles.m and the code returns statistics of spindle detection (precision, sensitivity, and F1 score) and a vector of spindle prediction
